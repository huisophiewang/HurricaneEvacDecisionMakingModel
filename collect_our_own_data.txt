Ideas:
- diverse sample (especially race)
- perception of risk
- social network information, family, close friends
- emotion, what did they see or hear?
- captures the time scale, as time goes, info changes, decision changes


Other crowd sourcing platforms:
- volunteer science neu
- Upwork

facebook study:
- http://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/03/ce-corner.aspx
  Rewarding participants with an enjoyable experience or interesting feedback can achieve a much better result
  e.g. myPersonality
- seems you can filter the result by location afterwards, but can't filter it beforehand, 
  maybe ask question about location, and hurricane experience at the beginning?
  
Twitter study:
- Twitter Polls
- How to find the target population (people experiencing hurricanes?)


twitter data analysis:
- more exploratory, more interesting
- key information missing
- may not have solid result
- emergency response (survey paper)
  more towards information extraction 
  information processing operations such
  as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing.
- extract location from twitter (survey paper), 
  ground truth is manual labeling
- categorize or cluster different types of messages
