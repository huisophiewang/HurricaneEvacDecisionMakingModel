questions:
- how to evaluate EM result?
	cross-valid?
	log likelihood?
	bic score
	KL divergence
	
--------------------------
KL divergence:
all the models we build, they have the same joint distribution, because we build from the same set of data
if from different sets of data, we can compute histogram, and KL divergence, like in personality project



==========================
	
- select a set of variables

- assume complete data
	learn parameter
	learn structure
	learn both
	
- assume incomplete data
	learn parameter
